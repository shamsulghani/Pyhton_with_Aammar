# logical operators or either "true or false" or "yes or no" or "0 or 1"
# equal to                      ==
# not equal to                  !=
# less than                     <

# less than and equal to        <=
# greater than and equal to     >=

#is 4 equal to 4?

# print(4==4)
# print(4!=4)
# print(4>3)
# print(3>6)
# print(3<=5)
# print(5>=4)

#applications of logical operators
#let suppose school admission age minimum limit is 5
# hammad_age=4
# age_at_school=5
# print(hammad_age==age_at_school) #answer show false

# input function and logical operator
age_at_school=5
hammad_age=input("How old is hammad? ") #input function
hammad_age=int(hammad_age)
#print(type(hammad_age))
print(hammad_age==age_at_school) #logical operators
