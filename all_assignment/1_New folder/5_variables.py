#Variables: objects containing specific values
# two types of variables
# 1: x= 5 (numeric variable)
# print(x)
# # 2: y= "Hello World!" string variable
# print(y)


# #variables can be updates in descending orders for example

# print(x+x+6) # answer 16
# also we can change the value of the variables
# x=10
# print(x) #ans will be 10 in terminal
# types/class of variables
# type(x)
# print(type(x)) # x class is integer as we supposed to 10 
# print(type(y)) #y class sting as we equal it to hello world

#print_type_class

# Rules to assign  a variable
# 1- The variables should be letters, numbers or underscores_
# 2- Do not start with numbers like (2x)
# 3- Spaces are not allowed
# 4- Do not use keywords used in functions in (python) like break, mean media, test etc.)
# 5- Short and descriptive
# 6- Case senstivity (lower case and upper letters, lower case recommended)

fruit_basket= "mangoes"

# fruit_basket=8
print(type(fruit_basket))
print(fruit_basket)
